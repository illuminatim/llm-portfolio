# LLM Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio of Jupyter Notebooks and projects 
created while following the Udemy course 
**"LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents" by Ed Donner**, 
as well as my own experiments with AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Contents
- 📓 **Course Exercises** — Notebooks based on assignments and daily exercises from the course.  
- 🤖 **Experiments** — Custom experiments exploring LLMs, agents, and AI workflows.  
- 🛠️ **Tools & Utilities** — Small helper scripts and utilities developed along the way.  

## Goals
This portfolio is intended to:
- Showcase my learning journey in LLM engineering.  
- Document experiments, insights, and best practices.  
- Serve as a foundation for future projects and collaborations.  

## Tech Stack
- Python, Jupyter Lab  
- OpenAI API  
- Ollama (for running local LLMs)  
- Anaconda environment

🚀 *Work in progress — I will keep updating this portfolio as I progress further through the course and my own projects.*
